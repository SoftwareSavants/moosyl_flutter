## 0.0.1

## 0.0.2

- Fixed a bug in the payment processing flow.

## [0.0.2] - 2024-10-05

### Fixed

- **Export fix**: Made sure that only the `SoftwarePay` widget is exported and internal classes such as `Pay`, `SoftwarePayBody`, `AvailableMethodPage`, and `_ModeOfPaymentInfo` remain private and inaccessible from outside the package.
- Resolved issue with incorrect import exposure of internal classes.

* TODO: Describe initial release.
