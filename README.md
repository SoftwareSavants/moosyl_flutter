## üìò Usage

### Step 1: Create a Payment Request

Before displaying the payment interface in your Flutter app, you need to create a payment request from your backend using the Moosyl API. Use your **secret API key** to authenticate the request. Here's how to do it:

#### cURL Example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moosyl.com/payment-request \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "phoneNumber": "+22212345678",
  "transactionId": "your-unique-transaction-id",
  "amount": 5000
}'
```

#### Node.js Example:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function createPaymentRequest() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.moosyl.com/payment-request', {
      phoneNumber: '+22212345678', // Optional
      transactionId: 'your-unique-transaction-id',
      amount: 5000, // Amount in the smallest currency unit
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });

    console.log('Payment Request Created:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating payment request:', error.response.data);
  }
}

createPaymentRequest();
```

Once the payment request is created, the backend will return details including the **transactionId**, which you will pass to the Flutter app for further processing.

### Step 2: Display the Payment View

Here‚Äôs how you can use the **MoosylView** widget in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:moosyl/moosyl.dart';

class PaymentScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MoosylView(
      authorization: 'YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY',
      transactionId: 'TRANSACTION_ID', // Retrieved from your backend
      organizationLogo: const Text('Your Logo Here'),
      customHandlers: {
        PaymentMethodTypes.bimBank: () {
          print('Custom handler for BIM Bank payment method');
        },
      },
      onPaymentSuccess: () {
        print('Payment was successful!');
      },
    );
  }
}
```

This example showcases the essential **MoosylView** widget, where you can configure:

- **`authorization`**: Your Moosyl authorization token.
- **`transactionId`**: The unique transaction identifier returned by your backend.
- **`customHandlers`**: Define custom actions for specific payment methods.
- **`onPaymentSuccess`**: Handle successful payment events.
